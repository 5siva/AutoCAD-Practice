## 📌 Practice 01: Polar Method

**Focus:** Drawing lines using polar coordinates  
**Formula:** `@length<angle`  
**Quadrants:**  
- 1st: 0°–90° (`@10<45`)  
- 2nd: 90°–180° (`@10<135`)  
- 3rd: 180°–270° (`@10<225`)  
- 4th: 270°–360° (`@10<315`)

## 📌 Practice 02: Circle Commands

**Focus:** Drawing circles using different methods  
**Commands Used:**  
- `C` – Center & Radius / Diameter  
- 2-Point, 3-Point  
- Tangent-Tangent-Radius  
- Tangent-Tangent-Tangent  

---

## 📌 Practice 03: Trim & Extend

**Focus:** Modifying geometries  
- `TR` (Trim): Removes intersecting segments  
- `EX` (Extend): Stretches lines to meet boundaries
